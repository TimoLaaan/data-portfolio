The goal of this project was to answer the two main business questions stated below and presenting it to a stakeholder (The written report and presentation were given to DataCamp employees and were both assessed with 'Pass' awarding me the 'Data Scientist' certification)

## Dataset
- Source: DataCamp final exam of the 'Data Scientist Certification'
- Description: Project includes a csv-file showing information about recipe properties and popularity

## Key Questions & Tasks

- 'Minimize the chance of showing unpopular recipes on our website'

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- sklearn
- matplotlib / seaborn

## Key Insights
- Data cleaning process showed strong flaws in data quality making the analysis difficult
- The baseline model suggests vegetable, potato, and pork recipes are more popular on your website, so consider taking that into account when deciding what recipes to show
- Use the models I created to predict popularity of recipes to aid the process of deciding which recipes to show!
